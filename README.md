🩸 BloodSync

BloodSync is a full-stack application designed to help coordinate blood donations during medical emergencies. The platform aims to reduce delays in finding compatible blood by connecting donors, patients, hospitals, and blood banks through a centralized system.
In many real-world situations, blood availability depends on manual calls, messages, and fragmented contacts. BloodSync is built to replace this with a structured digital solution that enables faster requests, better visibility of donors, and smoother coordination.


Why BloodSync?

In many emergency situations, patients face:
Difficulty finding compatible blood donors in time
Lack of a centralized, real-time donor database
Delays caused by manual coordination through calls and messages
BloodSync aims to solve these problems by creating a single platform that can streamline blood donation coordination.
